# Audio Transcript with Recorder

## 📜 Overview

This project is a basic prototype that includes:

- A working **audio recorder** with real-time visualization  
- A simple **sidebar navigation**  
- A **top menu bar** for easy access to sections

It’s designed to serve as a **foundation** for building more complex audio recording and transcript processing applications.
